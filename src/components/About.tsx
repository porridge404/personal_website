               Iâ€™m a Research Associate with over six years of experience in cell therapy, with training in both academic and industry labs. In industry, I specialized in multi-color flow cytometry, where I generated critical process data, presented findings in departmental meetings, and designed a 32-color panel for starting material characterization.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Additionally, I have experience applying supervised machine learning to biological datasets. As an undergraduate at Santa Clara University, I developed predictive models for EEG states as part of a brain-computer interface project. More recently, I trained a supervised model on sleep data to demonstrate my ability to identify and communicate key insights, maintain technical fluency, and stay current with modern ML libraries and AI coding tools.

                As for my personal hobbies, I love cooking, making music, playing cards games (ask me about EDH/commander!), and pushing high-level dungeons and raids with my World of Warcraft guild!

                I'm actively seeking opportunities in the Seattle, Portland, and Bay Area regions where 
                I can contribute to meaningful projects at the intersection of biotechnology and data science. 
                I'm particularly interested in roles that allow me to apply machine learning and computational 
                methods to advance biomedical research, particularly in immunology and cell therapy applications.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I'm also passionate about working on projects that directly impact patient outcomes and 
                contribute to the development of next-generation therapeutic approaches. Whether it's 
                developing new algorithms for analyzing biological data or optimizing experimental workflows, 
                I thrive on challenges that push the boundaries of what's possible in modern medicine.

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I'm looking for a collaborative environment where I can grow both as a scientist and 
                as a technologist, working alongside multidisciplinary teams to tackle complex challenges 
                in biotechnology and healthcare. Whether it's a biotech startup, pharmaceutical company, 
                or research institution, I'm excited about opportunities that combine scientific discovery 
                with technological innovation.
